I'm Irvin an undergrad at UC Berkeley, studying Math and Computer Science.

I enjoy learning about Machine Learning and Hardware. My current interests lie in the design of accelerators and [deep learning architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0759).

If you want to learn more about AI/ML, feel free to check out my [notes](https://github.com/irvinavalos/uni-course-notes).
