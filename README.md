I'm an undergrad at UC Berkeley, studying Math and Computer Science.

I enjoy learning about Machine Learning and Hardware. My interests lie in the design of accelerators and [deep learning architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0759).

On the off chance I step away from the terminal, I enjoy playing:

* Counter-Strike 2
* Balatro
* Civilization VI
